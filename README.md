A program that rolls multiple different pollyhedral dice via a command line prompt. Written during the Charity Marathon Desert Bus for Hope (https://desertbus.org/about/)


## Aims

The Aims of this were to improve my programing skills in a couple of areas. Firstly, improve my ability to test randomness and improve my understanding of using mocks, doubles and stubbs in RSpec. Secondly to improve my object oriented design capabilities. Third to make use of, and better understand duck typing.
